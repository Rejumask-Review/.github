How Does LED Light Therapy Work?

LED light therapy works by using specific wavelengths of light to penetrate different layers of your skin. These wavelengths activate cellular processes that promote skin healing, rejuvenation, and overall skin health. Hereâ€™s how each light works:

Red Light: Stimulates collagen production, which helps reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and sagging skin.
Blue Light: Destroys acne-causing bacteria, effectively treating existing breakouts and preventing new ones.
Infrared Light: Penetrates deeper into the skin, increasing blood circulation and supporting skin renewal at a cellular level.

This combination of targeted wavelengths ensures that Rejumask can effectively address multiple skin concerns at once.
